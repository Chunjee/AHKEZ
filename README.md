# Hyper Tuned AHK

Hyper Tuned AHK is a Library for AutoHotkey that strives to make the language more consistant, accessible, and modern.


# How to Use #

1. Copy export.ahk to your project or [AHK Library folder](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Functions.htm#lib)
1. Try the Hello World example
1. Add the following at the top of your AHK script: `#Include <AHKEZ>`
1. Study the [AHKEZ docs](https://jasc2v8.github.io/AHKEZ/)
1. Write code using AHK_L_v1 or AHKEZ, or both!
1. Enjoy writing AHK scripts with minimal confusion when to use `variable` or `%variable%`


# Changes #

1. Most commands have Function() wrappers
1. Most Gui commands have Gui() wrappers intended for quick creation of simple Guis
1. Some utility functions have been added


# Why? #

I love AutoHotkey. However, when I want to write an AHK script I get stuck trying to figure out when to use the percent signs for variables or %variables%.

I want to use it to write code without trying to remember the syntax and use of percent signs.  Hyper Tuned AHK solves this problem - Now I can just write code and enjoy this awe-inspiring language!
